    <h2><b> Directions</b></h2>
    
    <ol> 
        <li> Preheat oven to 350ยบ and butter and flour two 9" cake pans. Prepare red velvet cake batter according to box instructions.</li>
        <li> Divide batter among prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 32 minutes. Let cool slightly in cake pans, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Using a serrated knife, level out tops of the cake so they're flat (save scraps for decorating!).</li>
        <li> Make cheesecake layer: Line a 9" springform pan with parchment and spray with cooking spray. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and combined, 3 minutes. Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour, vanilla, and salt and beat until combined.</li>
        <li> Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly in the center, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to cool completely and firm up before assembling.</li>
        <li> Make cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until light and fluffy, then add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.</li>
        <li> Assemble cake: On a cake platter, place one red velvet cake. Top with cheesecake layer, pressing down firmly, then top with second red velvet cake.</li>
        <li> Using an offset spatula, frost cake with cream cheese frosting.</li>
        <li> Garnish with red velvet cake crumbs before serving.</li>
    </ol>
